Safety things to be aware of!

DO NOT DO MEETUPS AT YOUR HOUSE!

Do not give people your real address, instead do meetups across the street at a public building, like a park or gas station. This is because if they have a problem with a product they wont pull up to your house 💀

DO NOT GIVE YOUR REAL NUMBER OUT!

Make sure to download the app called “Google Voice” . It's a free second number, this is to insure your safety. People can get A LOT of info through your real number, and having a second number ensures safety on your end because there's no way to track it or get any info through it. You can also accept calls on it, just make sure to click “1” when they call you, it'll appear as a normal call on your number but it's not. 

BUYER WANTS A REFUND?

If a buyer wants a refund, it's up to you what you wanna do, you can either just block the person which does come with some risks (It's usually fine if the deal is under $100 but if it's anything above that, then be careful I'll go over what can happen with situations like that), or you can simple just refund them. If you block people on big orders, you gotta be careful not to get set up. What I mean by that is, you do not want them to make another account text you and try to buy smth. Its happened to me twice, on airpod maxes. Normal airpods u should be good but when its big money, thats up to you if you wanna take that risk

PROTECT YOURSELF

If you're from a violent area doing a BIG $ meetup, carry some pepper spray, a weapon, or a taser. This is to insure safety because you don't wanna get robbed. Never happened to me, but it's happened to some ppl I know on Iphone meetups and stuff. Just be careful.
