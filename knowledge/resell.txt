1️⃣ Building Your Foundation
Reselling is one of the easiest business models to get into. The concept is simple: buy low, sell high. But that doesn’t mean you’ll get rich overnight. Sales can be slow at first, you may lose money, and you’ll definitely want to quit at some point. That’s all normal
This is not a get-rich-quick scheme. If you're not willing to put in the work, this guide won't help you. But if you act with speed and consistency, you’ll start making money fast.
"The faster you move, the faster you make money." Everything is laid out for you. Now it’s your turn to execute.
Every successful reseller knows that market research is non-negotiable. You need to identify what brands and products are actually in demand before you buy anything. Otherwise, you’ll be stuck with inventory that doesn’t move.
Top 3 Products to Start With
AirPods (Pro 2 & Gen 4): Apple = consistent demand. Its not saturated, people just don't know how to sell - not good for long term and expect some returns
Cologne: Cheap to source, high resell value. Great examples: Jean Paul Gaultier, YSL, Valentino, Dior
Clothes: High turnover if you know what’s trending. Examples: Chrome Hearts, Hellstar, Denim Tears, Amiri.
Market Research Steps:
Go on platforms like Facebook Marketplace or Ebay. Filter to show only sold these are the best to see what's selling
Look at listings with lots of sales, saves, and views.
Track what sells locally and online — every region is different.

2️⃣ High Quality Suppliers
If you don’t have:
Great prices
High-quality products
Fast and reliable shipping
All the suppliers under the trusted suppliers section are good to go for any purchase
3️⃣ How To Order From Suppliers
Buy in Bulk
Suppliers give better deals the more you buy. Higher quantity = lower price and cheaper shipping per unit. Ask for the MOQ (Minimum Order Quantity) and try ordering slightly above it to lock in better pricing.
Don't Waste Their Time
Don’t DM asking “what do you sell?” — it makes you look like a rookie. Do your homework first. Know what you want before hitting them up. You can also ask for their catalog but be ready to buy
Build Real Relationships
A reliable supplier = consistent quality, faster shipping, and even discounts. Once you find a good one, stick with them and keep communication clean.
Be Professional
Use bullet points, proper grammar, and be specific. Example: “300 pcs, black, logo on left sleeve.” Suppliers respect serious buyers.
Plan Ahead
Always factor in delays — holidays (especially Chinese New Year), shipping times, and customs. Stay stocked so you’re not scrambling last-minute.
This is a Business — Act Like It
The pros track their inventory, margins, and build supplier relationships. Don’t bounce around — find what sells, double down, and build systems.
4️⃣How to Leverage Credit
You don’t need thousands to start. Start small — buy one $40 product, flip it for $100, reinvest.
Credit Cards = Cheat Code (if used properly)
Use the bank’s money, not your own.
Always pay your credit card in full to avoid interest.
This is how I scaled fast — by using responsible credit to buy inventory.

THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE
5️⃣How to Maximize Sales
What Platforms to List Products On
When it comes to listing your products on selling platforms there’s one thing you have to remember. The more eyeballs and attention you have on your product, the more sales youre going to make. The reason most people struggle with sales is because they’re lazy, they don’t want to take the time out of their day to make money and list on all selling platforms. But that's not YOU. LIST ON ALL SELLING PLATFORMS.
The selling platforms consist of:
eBay: Offers consistency and eliminates the need for face-to-face transactions., Buyers often accept listed prices, reducing negotiation efforts., However, be cautious of potential hurdles like account suspensions or listing removals.,
Facebook Marketplace: Popular choice for local sales., Attracts numerous potential buyers.,
Social Media (Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, YouTube, Pinterest, etc.): Often overlooked for sales potential., Effective channels to showcase and sell products.,
StockX: Suitable for selling sneakers and apparel with an authentication process., Successful sales result in decent payouts and swift transactions., Be aware of a 15% fee and potential suspension if authentication fails.,
OfferUp: Solid user base with many success stories., Effective platform for sellers.,
Alias: Reselling application focused on sneakers and apparel., Includes an authentication process.,
Grailed: Unique authentication process allowing buyers to purchase before authentication., Provides a distinct selling experience.,
Mercari: App-based marketplace for clothing, electronics, and more.,
Depop: Specializes in clothing sales., Generates considerable sales volume.,
5miles: Alternative platform for selling items.,
Extras: Poshmark and Vinted
Explore Additional Marketplaces: Diversify your selling strategy by exploring other platforms beyond those listed here.
You don't need ALL of these apps but the more the better
Ex. If you're selling airpods/electronics or fragrances use local apps like FB Marketplace or Offerup since online platforms tend to take listings down more on newer accounts.
Ex. If you’re selling products like clothes,hats, accessories and fragrances you should list on the all the platforms named above. Some platforms are strict with big Designer brands but there is also a method to avoid your listings getting down which will be explained below. Depop is amazing for clothing though
6️⃣How to List Products
Focus on:
Searchable, clear titles
High-quality images
Simple, compelling descriptions
Title Format: [Brand] [Product Name/Model] [Key Feature] [Condition] [Size if needed]
Examples:
AirPods Pro 2nd Gen (USB-C) | NEW & SEALED Don't mention “Apple” for Airpods
Chrome Hearts Cross Hoodie | Size L | Great Condition
Baccarat Rouge 540 70ml | 90% Full 
How to Take High Quality Pictures: 
Take multiple pictures of your product including the front, back, details, tags or important details that show product authentication or high quality.
Ex. for clothes:
Ex. for AirPods:
IMPORTANT:
List AirPods as used, even if they’re new
List fragrances as testers on Ebay and use stock photos as well to prevent listings from being taken down
How to Add a Description
Use this structure:
Headline (catchy and bold)
Key Features (3–5 bullet points)
Emotional Hook (why they’ll love it)
Social Proof (tester results, reviews)
Scarcity (optional)
Call to Action (what to do next)
Example: 
VVS Moissanite Watch – Bust Down / Brand New
💎Moissanite Bust down Watch💎 
✅ Fully iced with VVS Moissanite 
✅ Passes diamond tester 
✅ Brand new custom made watch 
💸 Asking $1,500
🎁 Comes with box + papers – perfect gift ready to go 
📍 Willing to drive out for a meetup 📩 DM to secure it SELLS OUT FAST

How to Avoid Listings Being Taken Down
Tips to Prevent Your Listings from Being Removed or Banned on Marketplaces
Account Age: Let your eBay account mature before listing commonly replicated products. New accounts listing such items can raise suspicion and increase the likelihood of being flagged. Established accounts are less prone to such scrutiny.,
Product Listings: Avoid including serial numbers in your listings, as some suppliers reuse serials that can be identified. Ensure packaging authenticity; for example, genuine Apple AirPods don't come wrapped in plastic due to their eco-friendly packaging. Including such details in photos could lead to your listings being removed and raise buyer concerns.
Sell Genuine Products: Begin by selling authentic products before introducing replicas. Having a mix of genuine items boosts your credibility, even when you start selling replicas.,
Optimize Your Profile: Present yourself as a trustworthy seller with a well-crafted profile. Use a clear profile picture and provide detailed, accurate product descriptions. A professional profile enhances your legitimacy and trustworthiness.,
By following these recommendations, you can reduce the risk of your listings being removed and establish yourself as a reliable seller in the online marketplace.


OTHER LISTING TIPS AND TRICKS READ

These are some tips not many people mention or talk about
When products don't move - Sell it at what you bought it for. The reason why is because it's MUCH better for you to break even and get your money back instead of being stuck with product that doesn't move at all
This is a weird one but I saw you can use a female PFP to draw in more attention up to you what you do with this info😭 
Listings no matter how good they are can sometimes get NO views. To escape zero view jail you need to figure out what the problem is. Maybe you are shadow banned or maybe its low interaction
Escaping zero view jail tips. Have a friend/s message you for your listing AS soon as you post it
Boost your listings. Spend 5 dollars to make 100
List your item as free but in the title mention "SEND BEST OFFER". You might get a lot of BS but the more messages the more your listing gets pushed out to a serious buyer
List in MULTIPLE zip codes nearby you (using diff pics) to maximize visibility 
7️⃣  How to Upsell
Sales skill = extra profit.
Bring multiple products to meetups. Be safe about it though 
Offer bundles: “Grab 2 and I’ll give you a discount
Almost every meetup can double your profit if you upsell right.

Example:
Let's say for example you are meeting up with someone who is buying a Hellstar shirt from you. You have the shirt but when you hand it over to him pull out a cologne and say "Yo bro, this cologne is selling super hot right now like people are selling these for 300 right now (Add hype/desire to it). But since you are here already I can give you a discount and sell this cologne for ONLY 120 (Make buyer feel like they got a steal). Imagine if you got a brand new shirt AND a cologne like you would get every girl" (Sell the dream, not the product).

A simple 5 SECOND interaction like that could change your profit from 150-300 just like that. You have to remember people don't buy the product for just the product/quality. They want something out of it like the brand name to stand out or the standout scent. Sell them the dream and people will buy whatever you offer.
8️⃣ How To Build A Brand
How to Build Clientele & Be The Plug
Start by dominating a niche:
Watches
Streetwear
Designer Reps
Post content:
Inventory drops
Product pics
Testimonials
Quality proof
Build a VIP List or Close Friends Story 
Add loyal buyers or interested leads to a “VIP” Close Friends list on Instagram
Show early drops, discounts, or sneak peeks there
Makes people feel exclusive & more likely to buy 
Provide Next-Level Service 
Be fast with replies
Offer multiple payment methods
Ship fast or deliver same day (if local)
Always send proof (tester videos, tracking numbers)
Being reliable builds long-term clients who refer their friends. 
Hype your drops:
Drop products like it’s a launch: "Only 5 available," “Next restock: next month.”
Use countdowns and sellout updates in your stories.
Build FOMO: Show people buying, wearing, and DMing you. 

Make it seem like a great deal. "Retail $600 - My price $250"

ADD A CTA (Call-To-Action) this is EXTREMELY important. The reason why is because most people will see a story/post and move on just like any other. But if you add a CTA like DM me for an exclusive discount code that adds an incentive and standout compared to other posts making you more memorable. By having them DM you as well you can make it seem more personal instead of a salesperson. 
Word of Mouth = More Sales
Offer referral bonuses or discounts
Create a commission program, Have others sell for you
9️⃣ How To Scale
Once you’re making sales, scaling is key.
Market Research:
This is the MOST important part of scaling - If you are out of the loop, you won't make as much simple as that 
Doing research and staying on top of trends is how you capitalize on BIG profits - Labubus and Golf Clubs are good example
You can do market research by either filtering items sold on ebay/FB or by staying on top of trends/posts for items online
Following authentic resellers is how I find out about this stuff most of the time
Reinvest:
Don’t blow profits. Buy more inventory, better products
Track how fast your items sell — double down on the fastest movers
Systemize:
Listing templates
Photo process
Spreadsheet for tracking sales, COGS, inventory
Cross-list:
Schedule time blocks in your schedule where you dedicate time strictly to listing products
Dedicate 1–2 hours for posting on every platform
Outsource:
Hire a VA or a friend for cheap to help with repetitive work
Bulk Deals 
Once you’ve found suppliers or products that sell well: Negotiate with your suppliers and buy in bulk for cheaper price per unit
Offer your customers bulk deals
Build Your Brand:
Post on IG/TikTok
Testimonials, unboxings, styling
Get customers to come to YOU
Use Auto-Responses & Templates 
Streamline your DMs/messages by having pre-written responses for: 
Pricing
Shipping info
Product details
Upselling (“Want to see more watches like this?”)
Fast replies = more sales. 
Diversifying Your Inventory
Don't sell just ONE thing: Invest in better-quality or more unique items (designer reps, moissanite pieces, rare streetwear)
Offer custom bundles or deals
Clients will start seeing you as a plug, not just a flipper
Track The Stats
Which platforms give you the highest ROI?
What products sell the fastest?
This helps you scale efficiently and make data driven decisions; not guess work
🔟  Resources And Supplies
When you're reselling you'll need supplies that can help you save time/cost, by fulfilling orders faster, and cheaper. When you're going through this list keep in mind, not all of this stuff is needed upfront it is a bit of investment so you can buy things as you go. As well there will be cheaper alternatives for these if you would like to look for them, these are just what I purchase/recommend.
Storage 
Having a good storage setup for your inventory is really important as you get more product, you'll need to be more organized so you can easily find product and not have your house looking a mess.
