Returns Guide
When you’re reselling, dealing with disputes and returns is just part of the game.
Since you're working with replicas, it's not a matter of if you'll get a dispute—it's
when. This guide gives you the tools and strategies to handle returns,
chargebacks, and complaints. Whether you're selling online or meeting buyers in
person, this information will help you handle different situations while keeping
your reputation and safety intact.

Disputes on Online Platforms
On online marketplaces, there are a few things you should always keep in mind
when a dispute is opened against you.
•

eBay Disputes: Don’t bother trying to win disputes here. Even if the buyer claims
the item is fake and you present your side, eBay almost always sides with the buyer.
They will be allowed to return the item, and there’s nothing you can really do to stop
it.

•

Vinted and Similar Marketplaces: On Platforms like Vinted give you more room to
fight back. If you have a receipt or certificate showing the item is legit, submit it
immediately. Their internal team will handle the case, and you have a decent chance
of winning.

•

PayPal Disputes:: PayPal disputes are similar to eBay’s, but slightly more flexible. If
you have proof like a RealAuthentication certificate, you may be able to win the
claim. Just know that fighting it is risky—while you could get your money back, you
could also end up with your PayPal account frozen. I’ve won multiple claims by
staying calm and submitting strong, convincing evidence.

What Kind of Evidence Should You Submit?
Receipts are essential. Without one, your chances of winning a dispute are near zero. Use
real-looking receipts—preferably physical ones printed thermally. Avoid using email
receipts; they’re too easy to fake and rarely trusted.
Good packaging and presentation also help. Most platforms ask the buyer for photos
during the dispute process. If your item looks clean, well-packaged, and authentic, that
goes a long way. Dispute teams have some understanding of what to look for.
Lastly, stay calm and confident. Don’t act defensive or aggressive. Be composed, as if
the item is obviously legit. When you sound confident and have your evidence ready,
you improve your chances a lot.

Disputes on Offline Platforms (Meetups)
When deals happen offline, like through direct messages, in-person meetups, or
private bank transfers, you need to assess your exposure::

•

What does the buyer know about you?
Were you paid in cash?
Did you use your personal details?
Did you ship from your own address?

Offline disputes are more serious. There’s no middleman like PayPal or Vinted to
mediate. The buyer decides how far they want to take things. Legal trouble is
rare, but not impossible. How you handle these depends on what the buyer
knows and how well you’ve protected yourself.

Handling Cash Payments
Scenario 1: Cash Payment, No Personal Info Shared
If you were paid in cash and didn’t share your real name, phone, or address—and
you used a burner number or stealth setup—you’re in a strong position. You can
likely ignore any dispute. There’s no proof the item is fake or that you’re the
seller. Most buyers can’t do anything in this case.
Scenario 2: Cash Payment, Personal Info Shared
If you used your real name, phone, or gave ID during the meetup, the buyer might
try to confront you. In this case, it’s safer to just refund the money. But avoid
meeting again in person—send the refund through PayPal or a stealth bank
account. You never know what kind of reaction someone might have if they feel
scammed.

Handling Bank Payments
Scenario 1: Bank Payment, Shipped from Alternate Address
If the bank account is under a different name and the package came from an
unrelated address, you can usually ignore any complaints. There's no strong link
between you and the transaction. Still, be careful—delete your accounts and
messages on local selling platforms just in case.
Scenario 2: Bank Payment, Shipped from Your Own Address
If the payment went to your personal account and you used your home address
for shipping, you’re exposed. In this case, protect yourself and avoid legal
escalation by refunding the buyer. Keep things polite and professional, and never
take risks over a single sale.

Preventative Measures
The best way to avoid disputes is to prevent them in the first place. That starts
with your listings. Make sure they’re detailed and honest. Use clear, high-quality
photos and describe the item properly. This is the first thing dispute investigators
look at. If your photos and description match the product exactly, it helps your
case a lot.
Second, keep your selling accounts in good standing. Positive reviews go a long
way in building trust. If a buyer sees that you’ve handled dozens of successful
sales with happy customers, they’ll be less likely to question authenticity or
escalate problems.
Good communication also matters. Be polite, responsive, and clear. If a buyer has
concerns, talk to them. Sometimes you can offer a partial refund or resolve things
before a full dispute even starts. It’s always better to keep a buyer happy than to
fight a chargeback.

Overview
This guide is short for a reason: the goal is to avoid needing it. Disputes are a
reality in this business, but they shouldn’t be the norm. Your job is to minimize
them through good habits, smart systems, and strong presentation.
When disputes do happen, weigh the situation carefully. If the buyer knows
enough to cause real problems—like your real name or address—it’s often best to
give the money back and move on. It’s a small loss now that could save you from
a big one later.
And always remember: in a dispute, you’re technically in the wrong. If the buyer
doesn’t have the evidence or courage to push it further, and you’re willing to carry
the risk, you can hold your ground. But in the long run, your business survives on
good feedback, repeat customers, and trust. Protect your reputation. That’s what
makes The Program work.
