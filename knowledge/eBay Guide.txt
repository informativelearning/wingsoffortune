eBay Guide
eBay is one of the largest and most well-known online marketplaces, offering
sellers a powerful platform to reach a massive global audience. It can be
especially useful for selling designer goods and high-demand products due to the
site’s credibility and buyer traffic. However, eBay has some of the strictest rules
among major marketplaces when it comes to listings, account behavior, and
policy enforcement. Because of this, you must be very calculated and cautious in
how you use the platform, especially if you're selling items that could be flagged
as branded, luxury, or potentially in violation of their policies.This guide will give
you a full breakdown of how to navigate eBay safely and strategically. You will
learn how to create and warm up an account so that it doesn’t get suspended
early on, how to list your items in a way that avoids red flags, and how to handle
orders, shipping, and customer interactions without triggering violations or
unwanted attention.

Understanding eBay Accounts
There are three types of eBay accounts you can have:
•
•
•

Personal Account – Your own eBay account.
Family Member or Friend’s Account – Using someone else’s account
with their permission.
Stealth Account – A last-resort option requiring anonymity.

Keeping Your Account Safe
To ensure the longevity of your eBay account, follow these precautions:
•
•

1

Don’t only list designer or branded products. Doing this can alert eBay’s
system and lead to your account getting suspended.
After creating a new account, don’t list anything right away. Wait at least a
few weeks—or ideally a couple of months—before adding your first product.
Begin by listing common household items. Things like used books, gift wrap,
or PlayStation controllers work well. Price them high to reduce the chances
of them actually selling.
Once you’ve had some normal activity, you can start listing designer goods.
Make sure to include regular items alongside branded ones (for example, for
every one or two branded items, include one unbranded item).
Buy a few items regularly through the account. Buyer feedback adds to
your seller reputation, and both types of feedback help strengthen your
profile.
If you’re managing multiple eBay accounts, always clear out image data
(EXIF) from your photos. This prevents eBay from detecting that the same
photos are being reused across accounts.

Overview
Before we go any further, it’s important to understand the top three ways eBay
connects your new accounts to any previous ones that have been suspended or
limited.
We’ll get into the details later, but for now, just know this: if a new account gets
linked to one that’s already been suspended or flagged, it’ll also get shut down.
You may have already experienced this if you’ve tried creating new accounts
and got hit with that “abusing eBay” message almost instantly.
So, how does this linking happen?ù
Here are the three most common methods eBay uses to connect accounts:
•
•

•

IP Address – Logging into different accounts using the same IP address can
create a link.
Browser and Flash Cookies – Every time you log into eBay, they drop
tracking cookies on your device. If you access multiple accounts without
clearing these or using separate computer profiles, eBay can detect it. We’ll
go over how to avoid this shortly.
Personal Information – Any details like your phone number, mailing address,
credit card, email, or bank info can connect your accounts if reused.

Creatingand Warming Up a New eBay Account
Step 1: Setting Up a New User Profile
For every eBay account you want to run, set up a separate user profile on your
computer. This helps keep browser cookies and flash data isolated, which is
important for preventing eBay from linking your accounts.
Another reason this helps is because eBay may flag your account if it notices
cookies or browser data getting deleted too often. When you use individual user
profiles for each account, all the cookies stay separate and intact, which keeps
eBay happy and avoids unnecessary verification checks.
Remember: eBay and PayPal track you using your IP address, browser cookies,
and Flash objects. The best way to avoid getting your accounts connected is to
stick with completely separate user profiles for every single eBay account. This
also means you won’t need to constantly delete cookies or worry about crosscontamination.

2

The only thing you need to be careful about is using a different IP address for
each account when logging in. That’s what we’ll cover next.
Once your new computer user profile is set up and you’ve understood how to
keep the account safe, your next task is to change your IP address.

Step 2: Resetting Your IP Address
Since eBay monitors your IP address, changing it is critical when setting up a new
account. There are several ways to do this safely:
Option 1: Changing Your Router MAC Address
If you’re using a setup with a modem, a router, and a computer, your
internet runs through the router connected to the modem. To get a fresh IP
address, you can simply change your router’s MAC address and reset the
modem. This might sound technical, but it’s actually quick and very
effective.
1.
2.
3.
4.

Visit IPBurger.com and note your current IP address.
Access your router’s setup page (default IP: 192.168.0.1).
Log in (default credentials are often admin/password).
Find the WAN MAC address and change the last 1–2 digits.
Once you find it, all you need to do is change the last one or two digits of
your MAC address and save your settings. For example, if your router's
MAC address is 0B:0C:0B:0D:0C:06, you can change it to
0B:0C:0B:0D:0C:07, then save your settings.

5. Save settings and restart your router.
6. Unplug your modem for 15 seconds, then power it back on.
7. Check your new IP address on IPBurger.com.
8. Keep a log of IP addresses to avoid reusing old ones.
How to Retain an IP Address with Your MAC Address:
If you want to reuse a certain IP later, save the MAC address you used to
get it. That way, you can go back to it anytime by simply switching the MAC
address in your router settings and restarting the modem. Be aware that IPs
don’t last forever—they can change on their own after a while. Stay
organized to avoid confusion.

Option 2: Router Swapping
This method is exactly what it sounds like. Buy a few cheap routers
(NETGEAR is a solid brand), and switch them out as needed. Each router
has its own MAC address, which helps generate a new IP when you reset
the modem. This method saves time since you don’t need to change
settings manually.
Steps:
• Get several routers with different MAC addresses.
• Switch routers whenever you want to change your IP.
• Restart your modem after each swap.
• Connect to the new network to get your fresh IP.
Option 3: VPN Connection
A VPN creates a private tunnel between your device and the VPN server. It
gives you a new IP address and encrypts your internet traffic, even hiding it
from your internet provider. VPNs are useful for more than just eBay,
especially if you’re blocked from using certain sites or apps.
However, VPNs are best for international users or those who have no other
way to get a new IP. If possible, try dial-up or the router methods first. Also,
if you use a VPN, go with a static IP instead of a dynamic one to reduce
inconsistencies.
•
•
•

Use a VPN with a static IP address for better stability.
VPNs encrypt your traffic, making tracking harder.
Dial-up connections can be used as a last resort.

Avoid Using Proxies
Proxies are not reliable. They’re more likely to get your account flagged.
Stick with router, dial-up, or VPN methods instead..

Keepinga Log of Your IP Addresses

..........
CommandPrompts That'llHelp!
•
•
•
•
•

ipconfig – Displays your IP configuration.
ipconfig /all – Shows all information about your IP configuration.
ipconfig /renew – Renews your IP address.
ipconfig /release – Releases your IP address.
ipconfig /help – Displays other ipconfig commands.

Creating a New eBay Account
Option 1: Using a Family Memberor Friend’sDetails
Use their full name, date of birth, and optionally, their address.
It’s best if this person hasn’t already made an eBay account. That way,
there’s no risk of accounts getting linked through shared details.
One big advantage of this method is that you can easily access verification
documents like an ID if needed.

•
•
•

Option 2: Using a Nickname or Name Variation
•
•

You can also go with a nickname or a small variation of your real name
(like using “Bobby” instead of “Robert”).
Keep in mind that banks and payment processors might reject
transfers if the name on your account is too different from the one on
your bank details. Try to keep the variation close to your actual
identity.

Listing Your Designer Items
When listing designer products, follow these best practices:
•

5

Avoid stock photos; take high-quality images yourself.

•
•
•

Use listing titles like “AUTH & NEW,” “AUTH & RECEIPT,” or “AUTH &
INVOICE” to indicate authenticity.
Mention in the description that full packaging and invoices are included.
Provide details on where the item was purchased.

Fulfillment and Handling Time
•
•
•

Always ship your items with tracking. This helps protect you if a buyer
opens a case or claims an item wasn’t received.
Set a realistic handling time for yourself—don’t promise next-day shipping if
you can’t keep up with it.
Make sure you stick to your chosen handling time. Missing your shipping
window can lead to penalties or restrictions on your account..

Increasing Selling Limits
•
•
•

New accounts have low selling limits.
Warm up your account before requesting limit increases.
Use services on Fiverr to raise limits safely.

Managing Your Account Post-Creation
Waiting Period Before Selling
•
•

Ideally, wait around 30 days before you start listing high-risk items like Louis
Vuitton bags or electronics.
If you can’t wait that long, you can start listing within 2 to 3 days—but know
that this comes with more risk.

Sales Strategy
•
•
•
•

Spread out your listings by using multiple eBay accounts.
Start slow: list one item per week to begin with.
Once each item ends, wait a few days before posting the next one. Repeat
this pattern for several cycles.
After each sale, give the account time to cool down before listing again.

Tips on Staying Under the Radar & Avoiding Violations on eBay
Rotate and Cool Down Accounts
•
•

6

After selling a high-risk item, stop using that account for a few days—
ideally 3, 5, or even 7. The longer you wait, the safer it is.
If you have multiple accounts, rotate between them so you’re not using
one too often.

Make Every Account Unique
•
•

Don’t copy listings across accounts. Use different product titles,
descriptions, photos, categories, and shipping methods.
Duplicate content is a red flag for eBay and could link your accounts..

Change Listing Details
•
•
•

List items in different categories (e.g., if you previously listed a wallet as a
"clutch" wallet, now list it as an "other" wallet).
Modify the title wording to make each listing unique.
Adjust fonts, sizes, layouts, and item descriptions to make them
distinct.
•
•

•

Example: One listing has pink text and a detailed return policy, while
another uses eBay’s auction templates with different image hosting.
Another variation: A black background with white text, a shorter
description, and an all-caps title.

Be creative—make each account appear as a completely different seller!

Vary Shipping Methods & Costs
•

Change the shipping service and cost for every account.
•
•
•

Example 1: Use UPS for $12 local and $30 international.
Example 2: Use your country’s postal service and only offer local
shipping at $10.94.
Example 3: Use a generic courier for $13.25 local and $34.25
international.

Use Promotional Features Strategically
•
•

Add bold, borders, featured listings,or other promotionaltools
occasionally.
Using Buy It Now with an offer feature can speed up sales:
•
•
•

•

Set the Buy It Now price close to retail.
Enable automatic offer acceptance at a pre-set price.
This method reduces listing time and minimizes exposure to eBay’s
VERO system and manual reviews.

Change listing durations too. Don’t use the same timeline every time. Mix it
up between 5, 7, or 10 days.

Revise Listings Smartly
7

• When editing an existing listing, consider adding something like a
promotional feature o make the update look natural.
• Avoid making the same kind of edit repeatedly without changing anything
else. If you keep revising listings the exact same way every time, eBay might
think you’re trying to manipulate the system.
• Don’t fall into a pattern. Switch it up occasionally to avoid raising suspicion.
Manage Account Activity Wisely
•
•
•

Do not withdraw all your earnings at once; always leave some funds in your
account.
If selling high-risk items, process withdrawals after entering a tracking
number for the order.
A safe balance to keep in your account is around $80-$150 to maintain a
trustworthy seller profile.

Feedback
Avoid Buying One-Cent eBooks
•
•

Buying ultra-cheap digital products used to be a quick way to get
feedback.
But eBay has caught onto this trick. If you buy too many cheap items in a
short time, your account can be suspended for feedback abuse.

Safest Way to Gain Feedback
•

Instead of digital items, buy small, physical products that can be shipped.
Good examples include:
•
•
•
•
•
•

•

Stamps
Coins
Beads
Baseballcards
Trading cards
Used books

Do not buy too many cheap items at once. Purchasing one or two lowcost items per day is acceptable, but anything excessive may trigger an
account limitation for feedbackmanipulation.

How to Find Affordable Items for Feedback
1. Go to eBay.com and use the search box.
2. Select the "Everything Else" category (found at the bottom of the
category list).
3. Choose any subcategory and initiate a search.
8

4. Locate the drop-down box on the right side above the first search result.
5. Select "Price + Shipping: Lowest First."
6. Look for items priced at $1 or more and bid on them or use Buy It Now.
7. After purchasing, wait a few days before leaving feedback.
Important: Do not buy items priced under $1. eBay watches for this and
could flag you for trying to manipulate feedback.

Do You Really Need Easy Feedback?
•
•
•

If your goal is to get more feedback just to boost your account, think
twice.
Feedback is not what drives sales or gets higher prices.
Having a professional-looking listing and answering buyer questions is
far more effective for building trust.

Final Recommendations
•
•

If you must increase feedback, purchase tangible items valued at $1 or
more every few days.
Do not buy more than one or two items per day for feedback purposes.

Suspensions, Violations, Limitations & Getting
Reinstated
Types of Suspensions and How to Be Reinstated
Some eBay suspensions can be lifted by following the appeal steps they
provide. But different types of suspensions require different responses.
Seller Non-Performance
•
•
•

If buyers complain about your service or you have a low feedback score,
eBay might suspend your account for poor performance.
Resolving issues, settling disputes, and collecting more positive feedback
can help restore access.
Check the feedback tips earlier in this guide if you need help improving
your score.

Non-Payment
•

9

If your account is limited because you owe eBay fees, just pay the
balance. Once your payment clears, your account should be
restored.

Shill Bidding
•
•
•

If eBay catches you bidding on your own listings to raise the price, they
may issue a short-term suspension.
These suspensions usually expire on their own after a few days, or after
you submit certain forms.
Avoid doing this again—repeat violations can result in a permanent ban.

Listing Violations
Competitor-Flagged Listings
•
•

If you’re in a competitive market, some sellers may flag your listings to try
and get them removed.
If you think this is happening unfairly, you can report the competitor to
eBay too.

VeRO (Verified Rights Owner Program) Violations
This happens when a brand owner reports your listing, claiming their rights were
violated.
A few VeRO removals can get your account permanently banned.
If You Sell Authentic Items
•
•
•

Contact the VeRO rights holder directly.
Some companies prohibit reselling specific items, including limited
editions, packaging, dust bags, certificates, and receipts.
Include as much proof of authenticity as possible, such as:
•
•
•
•

Supplier invoices
Serial numbers
Close-up photos
Verification statements from authorized dealers

If Your Items Are Not Authentic
•
•
•

Even if the quality is excellent, stop listing the item on that account for a
few weeks.
Post the item from a different account instead.
Follow the stealth and safety tips earlier in this guide to reduce risk.

Trademark Violations
•

10

Trademark violations are less severe than VeRO violations.

•
•
•

If your account is well-established, you might be able to take a few hits
without being banned.
For new accounts, one or two violations could lead to a week-long
suspension.
If you get a warning, stop selling the item that got flagged and avoid
relisting it for at least 30 days.

Suspensions and Getting Reinstated
If you receive a 7-day or 14-day suspension, follow these steps:
1. Do not use the suspended account until the suspension period is over.
2. Use an unlinked backup account to continue selling.
3. Try calling eBay at one of these numbers for assistance:
•
•
•

+1-866-540-3229
+1-877-322-9227
+1-866-961-9253

Account Limitations
eBay may limit your account due to:
•
•
•
•

Non-Payment
Seller Non-Performance
VeRO Violations
Perceived High-Risk Selling

To lift these limitations, eBay may request the following:
•
•
•
•
•

A copy of your driver’s license
Receipts or invoices for the products you’re selling
A credit card statement
Completion of a VeRO compliance test
Signed documents acknowledging eBay’s terms

Providing these documents greatly increases your chances of account
reinstatement.

Tips for a Successful Reinstatement Request
Be Patient
•
•

11

Do not spam eBay with multiple email submissions.
Reinstatement may take up to two weeks.

•

If you haven’t received a response after two weeks, you may resend your
documents.

Submit Clear and Legible Documents
•
•

Blurry or unreadable documents will delay the process.
Ensure all required information is visible before submitting.

Remain Professional and Polite
•
•
•

Do not send angry or demanding emails.
Reinstatement is at eBay’s discretion, and being respectful increases your
chances of success.
Provide any additional information they request promptly.

Why I Got Linked/Suspended – And How to Avoid It
in the Future
Your Account is Suspended
You might feel like your account was solid—everything looked good—then
suddenly, it’s suspended. This happens more than you think. Let’s break
down common reasons accounts get banned and what you can do to
avoid repeating those mistakes.

Common Reasons for Getting Linked or Suspended
• Changing your account info under a new IP – If eBay sees updated
account details while you're on a different IP, they may think your account
has been hacked and temporarily lock it. A quick call to eBay usually
clears this up.
• Using a shared network that had a suspended account – Just being on
the same internet as a banned account might not link you, but if you
reused details like addresses, you could get flagged.
• Reusing an address or sharing it with buyers – If you use a mailing address
tied to a suspended account, eBay could connect the dots. If someone
recognizes your return address, they might report you. To avoid this, use a
business alias (DBA name) on your return label.
• Inconsistent info between eBay, PayPal, and your cards – If your name,
address, or phone number don’t match across platforms, it looks
suspicious. Try to keep your details as consistent as possible.
• Using the same PayPal account for multiple eBay accounts – Even without
logging in, transactions can link accounts. You can usually only connect
two eBay accounts to one PayPal before risking a ban.

Using the same credit card on different eBay accounts – That’s a
guaranteed way to get linked and suspended.
Logging into multiple accounts from the same IP or browser session – This
is one of the easiest ways eBay links accounts. Always use separate user
profiles and switch IPs.
Getting too many buyer complaints – If your feedback score drops, eBay
may put selling limits on your account until you fix the issues.
Reusing a phone number from a past account – Never do this. Use a fresh,
clean number every time.
Listing too much too soon – Especially risky with electronics or luxury
goods. Take it slow.
Shill bidding – If you bid on your own listings and get caught, you could be
suspended temporarily or permanently.
Buying lots of low-value ebooks or digital items – eBay sees this as
feedback manipulation. They’ve cracked down on it hard, and reinstatement
is unlikely.
Using proxy or IP-hiding software – These methods are outdated and
unreliable. They often trigger eBay’s “abusing the platform” warnings.
Reusing the same listing titles, images, or descriptions from banned
accounts – These can all be tracked and reported by competitors or eBay
itself.
Logging into a suspended account before a new one – If you do this, your
new account is likely to be flagged.
Flooding your account with listings on day one – Uploading 20 items like
iPhones right away is almost guaranteed to trigger a suspension. Be patient.
Using official eBay tools like Turbo Lister – These can be risky. Consider
using alternatives like Auctiva.
Sending rude or aggressive messages to eBay – Always be respectful. A
bad attitude can work against you.
Reusing anything tied to a suspended account – That includes passwords,
emails, names, addresses, or even item images.
Listing while your account is in suspension – That’s a direct violation.
Pulling too much money out of PayPal at once – Withdraw funds gradually
to avoid suspicion.
Getting flagged by a competitor – This happens more than people think.
Stay professional and discreet to reduce the risk.

If your account has stayed clean for a month or two, and you’ve avoided all of
the above, you’re usually safe—just don’t slip up.

How to Stay Safe and Avoid Suspensions

Always have backup accounts ready – Don’t rely on just one account. If
something goes wrong, you need another profile ready to go.
Use different user profiles on your computer – This keeps cookies and data
separate for each account, helping prevent links.
Change your IP address when switching accounts – Never log into multiple
eBay accounts using the same IP. Rotate them properly.
List items carefully – Start slow, especially if you’re selling high-risk products.
Ease into things rather than flooding your account with listings.
Be respectful with eBay support – Staff members have the final say on
whether your account stays active or gets banned. Being polite and
professional increases your chances if you ever need help.
