Authentication Guide
Authentication is a term you’ll come across often while reselling replicas. As you
probably know already, there’s no such thing as a perfect 1:1 replica. Even
authentic products from the brand itself can have small differences, so it’s no
surprise that replicas—especially those made by different factories in China—
will vary. But that doesn’t mean you can’t make your item pass authentication
checks. In fact, there are ways to bypass certain authentication services and
even get certificates that help build trust with buyers.
In this guide, we’ll walk through the main types of authentication services, how
they work, which ones to avoid, and how to improve your chances of success
when submitting items. The goal is to help you resell with more confidence and
fewer issues.

Types of Authentication
Online Authentication
Online authentication is more common and easier to trick than in-hand
verification. That’s because these checks are often done by individuals who rely
on photos. Social engineering plays a big role here. It’s easier to influence a
person behind a screen than it is to fool a system or database, which is much
harder to manipulate.
Platforms for Online Authentication
These authentication services cover a wide range of brands and product
categories.
• Legit App: A Chinese authentication platform that uses a strong AI
system backed by two layers of human verification. It’s known to be very
tough to beat.
• Legit Check by Ch: This platform looks at a wide range of items across
different categories. It’s not very popular with buyers and doesn’t always
gain their trust.
• CheckCheck: Originally built for sneaker authentication, this service has
lost credibility. It often flags real items as fake, or fake items as real. Many
users online have shared complaints.
There are many smaller platforms, but they’re usually not reliable and don’t
have enough reputation to be worth your time.

Designer Authentication
Some online services are focused on luxury products like bags and high-end
clothes. They usually charge more (around $30), but they can be easier to
trick with the right approach and solid preparation. These platforms often rely
heavily on the photos and context you provide, so every detail matters.
• Real Authentication: A widely-used service that works with platforms like
eBay and Vinted. They often support sellers during PayPal disputes, which
makes them one of the most useful tools when selling higher-end
replicas. The base service costs about $30, and you can add a certificate
for an extra $10. Many users have reported success getting God Factory
bags through their checks, especially when paired with high-quality
photos and packaging.
• Entrupy: This is a premium service used mostly by boutiques. It requires a
special scanning device and costs around $300 per month. Their
certificates are digital.
• ProAuthenticators: A solid backup if Real Authentication rejects your
item. It’s a bit more affordable and not as strict, which makes it useful for
slightly riskier items. Many sellers use it as a fallback option when their
first attempt doesn’t go through.

In-Hand Authentication
This kind of check happens when platforms like eBay, Vinted, or Poshmark
offer to verify the item physically before it reaches the buyer. These services
usually occur after payment is processed and act as a final verification step.
How your product is presented during this process can make or break the
sale.
•
•
•

eBay: Available in certain countries. Items that pass get a blue tag and the
label “Authenticity Guarantee.”
Vinted: Offers optional authentication. They’ve been known to mistakenly
approve replicas, especially handbags.
Poshmark: Has a poor track record. Items like God Factory Louis Vuitton
bags often pass without issue, especially if you provide a certificate or
receipt.

Buyer Authentication
Sometimes, buyers will question the authenticity of an item after they receive
it. If this happens, it’s called buyer authentication. In these cases, having a
certificate from a trusted platform (like one PayPal respects) can help you win
the case. If you don’t have anything to back up your claim, it’s often better to
offer a return to protect your account from suspension.

If a buyer challenges authenticity:
•
•
•

If you have a certificate from a reputable platform (eBay, PayPal-trusted),
escalate the claim. This significantly increases your chances of winning.
If you're unable to justify the item's authenticity or the buyer is insistent,
it’s often better to accept a return rather than risking account suspension
If a buyer claims that a Louis Vuitton boutique told them the item is fake,
do not take their word at face value. Luxury boutiques do not officially
authenticate items for two main reasons:
1. Giving out authentication results can damage the brand’s image
and liability.
2. Authentication usually only happens in specific circumstances:
•
•

If the item is brought in for repair and it’s found to be a
counterfeit, they may refuse the service.
If a buyer has a close relationship with a sales associate (SA),
they may give an informal opinion off-the-record—but this is
rare and not official.

Sales assistants may give out business cards and even WhatsApp contact
details, but this does not count as official store verification.
By understanding these common tactics and knowing how these services work
behind the scenes, you’ll be better prepared to respond when disputes
happen and improve your overall success rate in buyer situations.

Bypassing Authentication
Sometimes, no matter how much you prepare, your item might still fail. That’s
just part of the game when working with replicas. Not all authenticators are
equal, and not all items—no matter how well-made—will get through. However,
there are proven strategies that can significantly improve your chances. These
involve careful preparation, choosing the right authentication service, and
crafting a strong, believable context around the item. Think of it less as 'getting
lucky' and more as building a smart system to consistently pass checks.

Preparing the Items
You should never start an authentication unless you have the following:
•
•
•
•

Item
Receipt
Packaging
Accessories

Your goal is to recreate the full experience of receiving a luxury item. For
bags and shoes, this means branded dust bags, ribbon, authenticity cards
(if real or high-quality replicas), and appropriate labeling. For clothing, tags
and plastic sleeves with size stickers can help. Even a small difference in
how the item is packed can affect whether it passes or fails.
Note:Avoid using fake StockX tags. These are oversaturated, and having
a StockX tag without other StockX accessories is an instant giveaway.

What Can You Do Instead?
Avoid using fake StockX tags. These are everywhere now and often get
flagged right away. If you want to include something extra, go for an old
eBay tag or a thank-you card that matches your receipt.

Authenticating Bags
1. Choosing the Right Service
•
•

Start with Real Authentication.
If your item doesn’t pass, go for ProAuthenticators.

2. Take proper Photos
•
•
•
•

Your pictures are the most important part. You want your setup to
look like it belongs to someone who buys luxury goods.
Place the bag on a marble counter or use a background that shows
taste, like a designer blanket.
Since bags are checked by people, the way you present your item
matters.
Avoid:
•
•

•

Blurry photos
Low-quality backgrounds (e.g., bedsheets)

Lightingis crucial:The canvas should have the right level of shine—
not too matte, not too glossy.

3. Deal With the Chip Issue:
•
•

Chips from God Factory with a “:5C:” scan code are now easily
recognized as fake.
One workaround is to include a screenshot from a real retail bag
instead.

Submitting the Check
Before you submit the item for authentication, it helps to include a short, wellthought-out note. This isn’t required, but it adds a human layer that can sway the
person reviewing your case. Use storytelling to your advantage. For example,
pretend you’re a woman clearing out her designer wardrobe and you need this
authenticated quickly because the buyer is pushing for shipment.
Since most services have a 24-hourturnaround, you can enhance your
chances with social engineering:
•
•

Around the 23rd hour, message the authenticators with a SE (social
engineering) plan.
Example:

Claim the bag was purchased in “X” location.
• Mention that you uploaded the receipt.
• Say you need the result quickly because your buyer is waiting, and
you must ship the bag soon.
However, this method may become oversaturated, so be creative in crafting
your own SE strategy.
•

Final Result: Authentication & Selling
•

If your item passes, download the authentication certificate in PDF format and
store it in your files for future disputes or buyer reassurance. A clean
certificate can help resolve returns or PayPal issues instantly. Some sellers
also print it out and include it in the package to reinforce legitimacy.

•

If your item fails, don’t panic. It doesn’t mean it’s unsellable. In most cases,
you can still move the item on platforms that don’t require authentication
—especially if your photos, description, and packaging are convincing.
Remember, most buyers aren’t professionals. They won’t scrutinize fine
details or scan chips the way an authenticator would. Presentation often
wins over perfection, so don't waste the opportunity just because of one
denial.

Authenticating Other Items
For sneakers and clothing, the same principles apply—only the packaging
expectations differ. With sneakers, you want to include the original-style box,
any sizing labels, and accessories like extra laces or tags. For clothing, hang tags,
size stickers, folded presentation, and store bags make a big difference.
Some sellers even create their own “proof of purchase” setups. This might
involve combining a real thank-you card from a past order with a printed
receipt and an edited packing slip.

These are soft authenticity signals that, when bundled together, make the item
appear far more legitimate—even without official verification.

In-Hand Authentication
When selling on platforms that offer in-hand authentication like eBay, Vinted, or
Poshmark, your success depends almost entirely on first impressions. These
inspections are quick, and the staff conducting them often make snap
judgments. That means everything needs to be perfect the moment they open
the box.
• Keep all items in smoke-free, scent-free, and pet-free environments.
Odors or stray hairs will raise doubts.
• Include all necessary accessories: dust bags, tags, cards, receipts.
• Use proper packaging: real branded boxes, tissue paper, and even
stickers. Avoid plastic wrapping that looks low-effort.
• Make sure the item smells fresh and feels premium. Some sellers
lightly spray the inside of the box with a neutral, luxury-like scent.
By maintaining a luxury presentation, you increase the chances of passing
authentication and making a successful sale.

Overview
Even though authentication services have become more advanced over time,
especially with AI and chip verification, they are still built and operated by
humans. That means they can be tricked, especially when the overall experience
and details are polished. You don’t need to fool the system—you just need to
satisfy the person reviewing your case.
In The Program, tools like the Legit App Emulator help prepare images or mimic
verification steps for basic platforms. But caution is key—some QR codes can
backfire if buyers scan them and see mismatched info. Only use verification
tools when absolutely necessary, and never overuse templates that could
become common or suspicious.
Luxury brands are evolving too. Louis Vuitton and Chanel have shifted from serial
numbers to embedded NFC chips. High-end factories are catching up by cloning
these chips, but inconsistencies still exist. Some work with mobile scan apps,
while others only pass visual inspection.
Ultimately, your job is to package the item with care, align every detail—from tags
to text—and make sure no part of the process raises questions. Replicas don’t
need to be flawless to sell—they need to feel flawless in the buyer’s hands.
