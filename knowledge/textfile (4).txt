Avoiding eBay’s Authentication for Brands ie LV , Supreme etc
💰 Reselling Tip of the Day – Avoiding eBay’s Authentication for Brands ie LV , Supreme etc 👕🔥

Want to sell a Supreme T-shirt on eBay without it going through Authentication Guarantee? Here’s how to bypass it and keep full control of your sale:

✅ Price it Under the Authentication Threshold – Keep it under $200 (or the current limit) to avoid triggering authentication.
✅ Adjust Your Listing Title – Avoid flagged keywords like “Box Logo” or “Limited Edition” that might push it into authentication.
✅ Change the Category – Try listing it under Streetwear > Other instead of Men’s Clothing > T-Shirts.
✅ Use Best Offer or Auctions – Some sellers bypass authentication by using Best Offer or auctions with a lower starting price.
✅ Sell as a Bundle – Include another item (e.g., another brand’s tee), as authentication applies to single high-value items.
✅ Offer Local Pickup – eBay mainly enforces authentication for shipped items. Listing it as local pickup only might work.

GENERALLY - changing the category works well to bypass this. Don’t change the brand to make some whacky ass shit like “Superme or Louis Vuittton” because people report this and it flags your account.
