Essential eBay Reselling Tips
If you're new to eBay reselling, follow these steps to avoid mistakes and maximize sales!

1️⃣ Build Trust Before Selling High-Ticket Items
✔ Day 1: List only 2 resell items + 5 random household items (clothes, books, electronics).

✔ Why? eBay limits new sellers. Selling random items builds trust & increases selling limits.

2️⃣ Always List as "Preowned" to Avoid eBay Scrutiny
✔ Never list items as "New" (even if they are).

✔ eBay flags new high-ticket items from new sellers, which can lead to bans.

✔ Instead, list as "Preowned" & add "Like New" in the description.

3️⃣ Use eBay’s "Promoted Listings" Feature
✔ Promote at least 3% (more = better visibility).

✔ If you don’t promote, your listing gets buried in search results.

✔ Example: If selling at $50, promoting at 3% costs $1.50—worth it for extra exposure.

4️⃣ Always Offer Free Shipping (But Adjust Price)
✔ eBay ranks free shipping listings higher.

✔ Add 
5
−
5−
10 to your item price to cover shipping costs.

5️⃣ Avoid Auctions – "Buy It Now" is Better
❌ Most auction buyers never pay.

✔ Use "Buy It Now" with a fair price & offers enabled.

✔ If you must use auctions, require immediate payment.

6️⃣ Use Best Offer to Attract Buyers
✔ Enabling "Best Offer" increases chances of a sale.

✔ Always counter lowball offers instead of declining.

✔ Example: If listing at $100, set auto-accept at $85 & auto-decline below $75.

7️⃣ Fill Out Item Specifics Completely
✔ More details = higher ranking in search.

✔ Include brand, size, color, model, material, condition, etc.

8️⃣ Use High-Quality Photos
✔ Bright, clear images = More sales.

✔ Use a plain background & natural light.

✔ Show all angles + close-ups of details/logos/tags.

✔ Avoid stock photos—real images build trust.

9️⃣ Price Competitively but Profitably
✔ Check sold listings (filter by "Completed & Sold").

✔ Price slightly lower than competitors for a fast sale.

✔ No sales in 7 days? Lower the price or increase promotions.

🔟 Get Happy Customers to Leave Reviews
✔ Positive reviews = more trust = more sales.

✔ Send a friendly message after delivery:
"Hey! Hope you love your item! If you're happy, I'd really appreciate a review—it helps a lot!"

✔ More good feedback = Higher ranking in search results.

Stay Active – eBay Rewards Daily Listings
✔ List a few items daily (not all at once).

✔ Even with 20 items, list 2-3 per day to keep eBay’s algorithm happy.

✔ Refresh old listings by editing price, title, or description.
