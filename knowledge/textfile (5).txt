Here's one, for selling online:
The same reason your listings get more sales is also the reason they’re more likely to get taken down.

Platforms primarily target high-volume listings. Once a listing hits ~50 sales and has been live for 2+ weeks, the chance of a policy violation increases exponentially.

What I do to prevent this:
After a listing reaches ~50 sales
Every Saturday night, I take the listing down
Wait 24 hours
Re-list it

This effectively resets the listing counter and dramatically lowers the risk of takedowns.

Results:
Last 4 months: 0 listings taken down
Before this: listings were getting removed almost every month

Use this strategy if you're running volume and want longevity.
