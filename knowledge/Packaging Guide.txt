Packaging Guide
Packaging is one of the most important aspects to consider when reselling
replicas. The right packaging can create trust and confidence in the buyer. If the
buyer knows what original packaging looks like, sometimes that alone is enough
to convince them the product is real. Building convincing packaging and setting
everything up correctly takes knowledge and practice, which is what this guide is
here to help you learn. By following what’s outlined here, you’ll be able to prepare
your products properly and create a near-flawless presentation.

Types of Packaging
Chinese Packaging
When ordering from China, replicas often come pre-packed with dustbags,
boxes, plastic wraps, and even fake receipts or tags. You should never use any of
these items. Most of them are poorly made and inaccurate. It’s best to throw
them away completely.
The only thing sometimes worth keeping is the branded hangtag. For clothing,
you’ll usually receive a plastic sleeve, some generic tissue paper, and a tag.
Throw everything out except for the branded tag. For bags, they might come with
a box and dustbag. Keep only the bag itself—everything else, even the fake
dustbag, should go straight into the bin.
Also note: items shipped from China often arrive with a strong factory smell. Be
sure to air out the products for a day or two before packaging them for resale.

Original Packaging
The best option is to use original packaging, which you can find on resale sites
and marketplaces (as explained in the Marketplaces Guide). Many people sell or
toss their old boxes and accessories after buying genuine items. These can
usually be picked up cheaply compared to the value they add.
Using authentic packaging or nothing at all is always better than including fake
packaging. It shows effort and adds credibility to your listing. Some brands like
Louis Vuitton sometimes include fragrance samples or cosmetics in the boxes—
if you can get your hands on these, they can make your packaging feel even
more premium.

How to Prepare the Product
Bags
What You’ll Need:
•
•
•
•
•

Box
Receipt
Receipt envelope or holder
Dustbags
Shopping bag (optional)

Make sure you have all the essentials prepared before selling a bag. The bare
minimum includes a clean box, a dustbag, and a receipt. Each of these should be
authentic. Replica versions of these items can often be spotted and will lower
the quality of your sale.
If you’re missing one item, it’s better to leave it out entirely than to replace it
with a fake one. For example, if your Louis Vuitton dustbag is missing, just tell
the buyer you lost it. That sounds more believable than including a cheap copy.
Most of these accessories, including receipt holders and boxes, can be found
secondhand on eBay. Sellers often get them from real purchases and are willing
to part with them at a low cost.

Clothing
Key Things to Have:
•
•
•
•

Receipt
Hangtag (branded)
Box (optional)
Tissue (optional)

Clothing is easier to prepare since it doesn’t come with many accessories.
Stores like Farfetch often ship clothes with just a receipt, hangtag, and some
return paperwork. When reselling, remove all plastic and generic wrapping.
You don’t need a box, but if you have one, it can improve the listing. Brands like
Celine or Louis Vuitton sometimes ship apparel in flat boxes. If you plan to sell
your item as “new,” including one of these boxes helps. If you don’t have it, wrap
the clothing in tissue and list it as pre-owned.

Shoes
Key Things to Have:
•
•
•

Box
Receipt
Tissue paper

Shoes usually come with a box that looks decent, but it might get damaged
during international shipping. Always inspect it before using it. If the box is
crushed or stained, get a replacement. Shoe boxes tend to be cheaper and
easier to find than bag boxes because they don’t have magnetic closures.
Fake cards like Dior or McQueen authenticity inserts should always be thrown
out. These are not part of the original product and including them makes your
item look fake.
Original boxes and tissue paper can be found easily on marketplaces. You
can often get everything you need— including the box and packaging— for
around $20. This is especially helpful when selling premium sneakers.

How to Improve Packaging and Trust
By using a combination of branded tags, email and printed receipts, and strong
packaging, you can almost guarantee a smooth sale. Buyers are far less likely to
open disputes when the overall experience feels premium.

Key Principles and Overview
Less is More
Never include a fake accessory. It’s better to leave something out than to add
an incorrect or suspicious item. Buyers may question a fake detail more than
they would a missing one.

Attention to Detail
Even tiny mistakes can ruin a good presentation. Watch for off-brand fonts,
logos, or materials. Always compare what you’re using against pictures of the
real thing.

Storage & Condition
Keep packaging in good shape. Store boxes flat to prevent bending or crushing.
Even high-quality packaging can look fake if it’s been handled carelessly.

ShoppingBags:These can add value in person but only include them if
you’re using a thermal or in-store receipt. Shops don’t give out bags for
online orders.
Branded Ribbons & Stickers: Many brands use ribbons or sticker seals to
close boxes. If you can find real ones, they’re worth using.
Box Quality: Real designer boxes have a specific weight, texture, and
design. Try to match those details if you use replica boxes.
Don’t Overdo It: Simplicity is part of luxury packaging. Too much wrapping
looks fake.
Fonts and Logos: These need to be exact. Get them wrong, and even an
average buyer might notice.
Wrong Accessories: Don’t include cards or booklets if the brand doesn’t
offer them.
Correct Layout: Watch unboxing videos to see how brands arrange their
packaging. Then copy it.
Used Look for Pre-Owned Items: A little wear on the packaging can make
your listing feel more real. No one expects a ٥-year-old box to look brand
new.
Screenshots: You can add screenshots of order confirmations to reinforce
your story—just be mindful of OPSEC.
Stay Honest: If something’s missing, just explain it. Buyers respect honesty
more than fake perfection.
Branded Shipping Boxes (Optional): Some luxury brands ship items in
branded outer boxes. If you can get one, it adds another layer of
credibility.

Item Sold—Now What?
• Wrap Properly: Fold or pack items the same way a store would. Watch
retail unboxing videos for reference.
• Double Box Everything: Always place the branded box inside a second
plain box to protect it during shipping.
• Smell and Feel: Don’t send items with a factory odor. Let them air out or
use a neutral freshener before shipping. Some sellers even use a spritz of
branded perfume for the finishing touch.
