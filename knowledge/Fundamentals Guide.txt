Fundamentals Guide
Welcome to The Program! As mentioned, this is your first guide, where you’ll
learn the main elements of The Program along with key concepts to keep in
mind. Working in the replica resale space sits in a legal grey area. While many
people operate in this market, it’s important to remember that success is never
promised—just like any business, it takes knowledge, proper planning, and smart
execution. It’s also important to note that selling replicas as if they were
authentic is not an ethical practice. That said, The Program is here to guide you
through this process in the best and most responsible way, with a strong focus
on customer satisfaction. The ultimate goal is to make sure both you and your
buyers are satisfied with each transaction. This will help you earn trust, get
positive reviews, and grow a strong reputation over time. This guide will walk you
through the fundamentals. Even if you’ve been with us for a while, we still
suggest giving it a read as a useful refresher.

The Program Panel
Since you’re viewing this in the Program panel, let’s explore its structure and the
purpose of each section.

Receipts and Tools
The main RECEIPTIFIED dashboard provides you with all the tools necessary to
resell effectively. You’ll be able to use the Unlimited Generator, App
Emulators, and View Bots (physicals will be finished and added in the future).
All of these resources will stay available to you for as long as you’re part of
The Program.

#1 Factories for Bags and Clothing
These sections highlight the main factories producing bags and clothing, which
form the foundation of The Program. We've selected and organised a list of the
top-performing factories, including short notes on what they’re good at and
where they may fall short. This helps you choose the ones that best fit your
business style and goals.

Suppliers and Middlemen
With over 800 suppliers listed, this part is vital for both reselling and personal
use. Though they’re not ranked like our #1 factories, these suppliers form the
backbone of the trending items. The middlemen section follows the same format.

Guides
The section you’re currently reading is where we keep all the essential learning
materials. The guides are carefully written to give you all the information you need
about reselling. They’re updated from time to time as new methods and trends
appear. There are nine full guides, each focused on a key part of building a
successful reselling business.

Choosing What to Sell
Choosing the right items to start with and managing your inventory can be
challenging, especially if you're new to reselling. To help you get started, let's break
it down:

For Beginners:
If you’re new, it’s smart to aim at getting your first investment back quickly. One of
the best ways to do this is with Louis Vuitton SLGs (Small Leather Goods), like
wallets or small items. They’re low-cost, don’t need many extras, and have great
selling power. Most come with NFC chips, which makes them easier to sell since they
closely match the real thing. You can usually sell them for around €200–€300,
meaning that one sale can easily make up for the roughly €100 you put in.

For Vetted Sellers:
If you’ve been reselling for a while, you can start looking into more expensive
products, like higher-end bags. In general, the more costly the item, the bigger the
profit you can make.
We highly suggest looking into designer clothing too. That said, I won’t dive deeper
here, because the best clothing to sell really depends on things like the season, what’s
trending, and other factors that keep changing. You’ll find all of that explained in detail
in the Discord.
In the end, what you choose to sell should match your experience, how much you’re
ready to invest, and what the current market looks like. We’ll keep you up to date with
all of that in the group.

What Will We Not Sell?
At The Program, we care a lot about making sure your buyers are happy. That’s
why we will never suggest or support selling certain items that could damage
your reputation or hurt the buyer’s experience. In particular, we strongly
recommend staying away from replica electronics.
Selling fake electronics is simply not okay. These products often don’t work
properly, break quickly, or stop functioning altogether. Even worse, they can be
dangerous—some can overheat, catch fire, or cause electric shocks. This puts
your buyers at serious risk and creates big problems for you as a seller. Besides
safety issues, selling counterfeit electronics can lead to legal trouble, banned
accounts, payment holds, and a permanently damaged reputation. It’s also one of
the easiest types of replicas to get caught selling, since platforms and payment
providers have strict rules around electronics. In short, it’s never worth the risk.
The Program's goal is to help you become a strong reseller, with happy buyers
who trust you. Focus on products that are safe, high-quality, and bring value—
don’t risk your business over items that can do more harm than good.

How to Start?
Now that you’re in The Program, let’s talk about how to get the ball rolling. We
suggest starting with a budget of around €250 to €300. This amount isn’t huge,
but it’s enough to get going with a few key items and the basic supplies you’ll
need to support your initial orders. These include receipts, consumables, and
potentially some packaging materials that help you create a more professional
image from the very beginning.
If you have more to invest, that’s even better—it can speed up the process by
allowing you to test more items and restock faster. However, if your budget is
limited, don’t worry. The Program is built to also support newcomers. With the
tools, knowledge, and community you now have access to, even a small
investment can be turned into consistent results. The key is to follow the
guidance we provide closely and stay active in the channels.

Understanding the Market
Before diving into reselling, it's essential to understand the structure of the replica
market. Not all replicas are made the same, and understanding this early on gives
you a huge advantage. You’ll hear terms like AAA, AAA+, and 1:1 thrown around
frequently, and while these labels are used a lot, many people misunderstand
them.
One of the most important things to understand is that the idea of a truly
identical 1:1 replica is more myth than reality. Even though there are high-level
replicas that can be incredibly close to the originals, there are always differences
—sometimes minor, sometimes more obvious. These differences may be in
materials, stitching, logos, packaging, or details only visible to experienced eyes.
By knowing this, you can avoid being misled by fake promises and instead focus
on sourcing from trusted factories that offer consistent, near-perfect quality.
Now, let’s break the replica market into three categories to make things
clearer: AAA, AAA+, and 1:1.

AAA Quality
This is considered low-tier quality. AAA replicas are often flawed, massproduced, and very noticeable. They’re the types you’ll find sold cheaply on
platforms like Instagram or Facebook. These items usually have obvious design
mistakes, poor stitching, and inaccurate branding. Best avoided if you're serious
about building a long-term reputation.

AAA+ Quality
These are mid-tier replicas. They often look decent to the untrained eye and
might pass in casual settings, but they still contain flaws. Fonts may be slightly
off, tags might not align with original placements, and chips or serial numbers may
not function or be incorrectly placed. They're often used by casual buyers and
are common in communities like Reddit’s FashionReps.

1:1 Quality (and Why It Doesn’t Exist)
This is the highest tier you can access. These replicas are extremely close to the
original products in terms of look and feel. The factories producing these invest in
copying small details—like stitching patterns, tag designs, packaging, and even
materials where possible.

4

Some even deconstruct original products to mimic them accurately. However,
it’s important to note that even the best 1:1 replica is not truly identical.
Differences in raw materials and internal construction still exist, but these are
the closest replicas you’ll find on the market.

Why "1:1" Doesn’t Exist
The truth is, for something to be truly 1:1, it would need to be made with the
exact same materials as the original. While some factories do come close, like
using genuine leather or stitching methods, there’s no way they’re using the
same exact materials that the original brands use. So, the idea of a "perfect"
replica—something indistinguishable from retail—is a myth. However, with the
right approach, including sourcing from the best factories, adding 1:1 receipts,
boxes, and perfecting the overall presentation, you can get really close to
making your items look indistinguishable from the real deal.
In summary, understanding the different quality levels of replicas will help you
make better choices when sourcing products for resale. The concept of 1:1
doesn’t really exist, but you can still get pretty close with the right tools,
materials, and approach. And that's what we're here for—to guide you through it
all and set you up for success!

Sourcing and Suppliers
Having access to good suppliers is one of the most important parts of succeeding
in this business. A reliable supplier can influence every part of your operation—
from the quality and authenticity of your items to how quickly they arrive and
whether or not they even make it through customs. Inconsistent or dishonest
suppliers can lead to serious problems: delays, lost shipments, poor-quality items,
and ultimately, negative feedback from buyers. This can hurt your reputation fast,
and in this line of work, reputation is everything.
When choosing suppliers, you're not just picking someone to send you products—
you’re selecting a partner who helps shape your business. You want someone with
clear communication, fast response times, a history of shipping safely, and, most
importantly, consistent item quality. Many new sellers make the mistake of going
with the cheapest supplier they find through social media or forums, only to
regret it after receiving poor-quality items or nothing at all.
Inside The Program, you don’t need to take that risk. We’ve done the hard work for
you by vetting and verifying suppliers who consistently meet our standards.
These are suppliers we’ve built relationships with over time. Many of them offer
value-added services such as product photography, quality checks, packaging
add-ons, and flexible shipping options.

5

Most ship via DHL with duty-free routes to help you avoid customs trouble and
import taxes, which can otherwise eat into your profits or create delivery
headaches.
In addition, many of the suppliers in The Program work with high-end factories
and are in direct contact with the source of production. This means you’re not
dealing with multiple layers of middlemen, which lowers your risk and reduces
your overall cost. Some even offer product previews or packaging options that
can help you enhance the presentation of your listings.
The Program gives you direct access to all the best options in one place, making
sourcing not just easier, but safer and more scalable. As long as you follow our
updated supplier lists and advice, you'll have a solid foundation for your reselling
business that saves time, reduces stress, and increases your chances of longterm success.

What Are the Main Disadvantages? Can I Lose
Money?
The replica market, like any business, involves risks. One of the most significant
and most common issues sellers face is losing shipments. Whether it’s due to
customs seizing packages, damage in transit, or courier mismanagement, losing
goods can be a big hit to your finances and morale—especially for new sellers still
building confidence.
Losses usually happen during the international shipping phase. While local
deliveries tend to be more predictable, the cross-border movement of replica
items adds a layer of complexity. Customs agencies in countries like the US, UK,
and parts of Europe are increasingly alert to replica imports, and they are known
to flag packages that appear suspicious.
The risk also grows with the value of the item. A single pair of high-end sneakers
may cost five times more than a wallet to source, and that means more is on the
line when something goes wrong. That’s why The Program recommends beginners
start with lower-cost, high-rotation items. These are easier to move, attract less
scrutiny, and are less painful to lose if something does go wrong.
That said, our supplier list and shipping guidance aim to significantly reduce your
risk. Most suppliers use discreet packaging, well-tested shipping routes, and
networks that avoid flagged carriers or delivery services. By sticking to the best
practices and asking questions in our channels when unsure, you can learn from
the experiences of others and avoid unnecessary losses. The more you learn
about logistics and risk management, the better your outcomes will be over time.

My Supplier Has Receipts with Items? Will It Save
Me Money?
It might seem like buying receipts and tags from your supplier is a smart shortcut
that saves you time and money. In theory, it makes sense—get everything in one
place, avoid the hassle of designing your own, and ship the product complete.
However, in reality, most of these receipts are low quality, mass-printed, and not
tailored to the buyer’s expectations. They are often printed with incorrect
formats, outdated logos, or entirely in Chinese, which immediately raises
suspicion for European or American buyers.
Many of these receipts are also duplicated across hundreds of sellers, meaning
your buyer could recognize it from a past fake purchase or see identical
examples on replica forums. Worse, some of the tags and labels provided by
suppliers are actually harvested from faulty or rejected items, which further
compromises the look and feel of your product.
By using our tools, you elevate your presentation and close more sales at higher
prices. Customers are more likely to believe in the legitimacy of your product,
and your store will stand out from low-effort competitors using generic materials.

How to Price Items?
Setting the right price for your items is key to keeping your business moving and
your inventory cycling quickly. A well-priced item doesn’t just boost profits—it
helps build credibility. Price something too low and your buyer might assume it’s
fake, broken, or low quality. Price too high and it might sit for weeks without any
interest. That’s why it’s critical to take the time to research and adjust your
pricing strategy regularly.
Start by browsing listings for the same or similar items on platforms like eBay,
Grailed, Reddit, and niche marketplaces. Take note of completed listings to see
what actually sold, not just what people are asking. Also observe how listings are
packaged—photos, descriptions, wording, and seller reviews can influence price
too.

7

Once you have a solid idea of the going rate, aim to list slightly below that
average. You don’t need to undercut dramatically. A difference of €10–€30 can
make a big impact on a buyer’s decision, especially if your item looks more legit
thanks to good packaging or receipts. Over time, as your reputation improves,
you’ll be able to increase your pricing without losing volume.
