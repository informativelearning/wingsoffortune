Marketplaces Guide
In this guide, you’ll learn which selling platforms are right for you, how they
differ, and which ones we suggest based on your location and the items you
plan to sell. Choosing the right marketplace depends on two main factors: what
you’re selling and where you live. Different countries have different access,
rules, and platforms. For example, EU-based sellers can’t use Poshmark due to
location restrictions. Knowing your options and how each platform works helps
you avoid problems and maximize results.

Different Categories of Marketplaces
General Marketplaces
Worldwide Marketplaces
These are the global platforms where people sell everything from electronics to
clothing. They include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

eBay
Poshmark
Carousell
Craigslist
Mercari
Facebook Marketplace
Depop

These platforms have huge user bases and strong buying power. You’ll get a lot of
traffic and eyes on your listings, especially if your photos and titles are good.
Many are also starting to include designer sections with authentication services,
which affects how you list and what you sell. However, large platforms also mean
more scammers and stricter moderation.
Account suspensions can happen fast. Fees can be high, which cuts into your
margins.
How does Authenticity Guaranteeon eBay work?
eBay’s Authenticity Guarantee is a service meant to protect both buyers and
sellers. When someone buys a qualified item, it gets shipped to a third-party
authentication center before going to the buyer. There, experts verify the item’s
condition and authenticity. If it passes, it gets sent to the buyer via fast,
signature-required delivery.

The program automatically applies to sneakers and handbags that meet the price
threshold. For most categories, items priced at $500 or more are included by
default. For designer handbags priced between $200 and $499.99, buyers can
still opt into authentication, but they have to pay an additional fee. Right now, the
program is only available in the U.S. for items shipped within the country. U.S.
territories and APO/FPO addresses are not eligible, and sellers outside the U.S.
are excluded from the program unless they ship domestically through a U.S.based seller account.
While this feature is helpful for buyers who are unsure about authenticity, it
creates new challenges for sellers—especially those working with replicas. You
can’t opt out once the price threshold is met. If your item is flagged or rejected
during the authentication process, it will be returned to you and the sale will be
canceled. This is why we advise members of The Program to avoid triggering the
guarantee whenever possible by staying just below the automatic thresholds or
focusing on items like accessories and clothing, which are less likely to be
affected.
What items shouldyou list on these marketplaces?
Avoid listing items that are priced above $500 if they’re likely to trigger
authentication. Stick to:
•
•
•

Wallets
Designer clothing
Small leather goods

If authentication is not available in your country (for example, eBay in Europe),
you can list higher-priced items such as expensive Louis Vuitton bags.
Pros:
•
•
•

High buying power
Many users, lots of views
Easier to sell

Cons:
•
•
•
•

2

High fees
Strict moderation
Authentication rules may complicate sales
Marketplaces often side with buyers in disputes

Local Marketplaces
These platforms function like the global ones but are restricted to a specific
country or region. They tend to have more relaxed rules and almost no
authentication processes. Examples include:
•
•
•
•
•

Germany – Kleinanzeigen
Austria – Willhaben
France – Leboncoin
Italy – Subito
Spain – Milanuncios

These marketplaces give you more freedom to meet buyers, accept cash or bank
transfers, and avoid platform interference. You’re more in control of the
transaction. While it may take longer to sell items, you can often negotiate
directly and avoid heavy fees.
Pro Tip: Mix in basic or unbranded items with your listings to look more like a
regular seller and less like a reseller. Having multiple accounts also helps lower
your risk of being flagged.
What items should you list on these marketplaces?
You can confidently sell any item, as authentication is rarely present and sales
are easier.
Pros:
•
•
•
•

Lower to zero fees
Good user base
Little to no authentication services
Meetups with cash or direct bank payments

Cons:
•
•
•
•

May take longer to sell
Buyers tend to lowball or bargain (varies by country)
Smaller audience
Rotating items/accounts is recommended

Clothing Marketplaces
These platforms focus on fashion—shoes, clothes, accessories, bags—and
generally attract an audience that knows the products well. Some have
authentication, while others don’t. There are two categories here: open and
closed marketplaces.:

Open Marketplaces
Vinted
Vinted is one of the largest clothing marketplaces in Europe and continues to
grow steadily across multiple countries. Its strict automation and moderation
tools mean it doesn’t take much for your listing to be flagged or removed. Still, if
you approach it with care, Vinted can be one of the most profitable and
consistent platforms available. The platform has a strong user base that actively
searches for mid-range designer items and niche fashion.
When it comes to handling disputes, Vinted is more balanced than many other
platforms. If you include proper documentation like real or well-crafted receipts
and keep your communication polite and professional, you stand a good chance
of winning a case. Some regions now have optional in-hand authentication for
higher-priced items, so it’s best to focus on products that don’t automatically
trigger this feature. Receipts, good packaging, and clear listings will help you
avoid returns or refunds.
To succeed on Vinted, don’t rush in with replica listings. Instead, begin with a
legitimate item from your own wardrobe. lder accounts with positive reviews are
far less likely to get flagged. Use a basic username and a profile picture that
looks like a regular user. If you do get banned, don’t panic. Simply register again
using new contact info.
Steps for Success on Vinted:
•
•
•
•
•

Do not list a high-risk item first. Instead, start with a genuine item from
your home.
Ask friends or family if they have an account you can use.
Accounts with reviews and history are less likely to be flagged or
removed.
Profile picture and username should appear normal.
If banned, you will need a new phone number to create another account.

2. Take Good Photos

High-quality images are crucial for making sales.
Use a clean background (living room, kitchen, bedroom) with good
lighting.
Ensure camera quality is sharp—no blurry or unappealing images.
Invest in a tripod for better stability.
Show all relevant details (e.g., front and back of clothing, labels, logos).

3. Write a Strong Description
•
•
•

A clear, detailed description tells customers exactly what they’re getting.
Use keywords to improve visibility.
Reduce buyer questions by including all necessary details upfront.

Grailed
Grailed uses photo-based authentication but doesn’t do physical checks. It’s
more strict than others when it comes to moderation. It’s best for niche fashion,
rare pieces, and items from brands like Burberry or old archive collections. Have a
receipt, and try to use an aged account to reduce scrutiny.
Best strategy for Grailed:
•
•
•

Focus on archive/vintage/lesser-known/couture brands (e.g., Burberry)
rather than hyped designer items.
Always have a receipt.
An aged account is recommended to avoid unnecessary scrutiny.

Depop
Depop is UK-based and more relaxed than Vinted or Grailed. There’s no
authentication, and conversations happen directly with buyers. Still, you can get
banned if disputes arise. It’s useful as a secondary listing site, though sales tend
to be slower and buyers often offer low prices.
Key things toknow about Depop:
•
•
•

Payments go through PayPal via the seller hub.
Items sell slower compared to other platforms.
Buyers lowball frequently, making it harder to maintain profit margins.

Best used as a backup listing platform to gain extra exposure.
Vestiaire
Paris-based platform for secondhand luxury goods and is known for being one
of the hardest to bypass due to its strict in-hand authentication. Every item is
physically inspected by their team before reaching the buyer, and even small
flaws or inconsistencies can lead to rejection. In rare cases, failed items may
be confiscated, especially in regions with stricter enforcement.
If you sell here, focus on small leather goods under $300. Many buyers skip
authentication for lower-priced items, making them safer. Use clean photos,
realistic receipts, and honest descriptions to reduce risk.

Closed marketplaces are platforms with strict entry requirements for sellers.
Unlike open or casual marketplaces, these sites enforce tight control over what
gets listed, how it’s presented, and who can sell. Most only accept brand new
items with tags, complete packaging, and no visible flaws. If your item is even
slightly damaged, missing accessories, or looks inconsistent with retail packaging,
it will usually be rejected. These platforms cater to buyers who want guaranteed
authenticity, and they are built around high buyer trust.
Because of this, closed marketplaces use both human and machine verification
methods. Even when you manage to get a replica listed, there’s a high chance it
will be flagged shortly after—especially if buyers report it or the system picks up
on patterns. If someone claims they can bypass these platforms 100% of the time,
they’re exaggerating. At most, some listings might temporarily slip through, but
the risk of removal, account suspension, or even investigation is high.

Here are a few closed marketplacesthat you should be aware of:
• StockX: The most well-known platform for sneakers, streetwear, and limited-edition
items. All items must be brand new and undergo in-hand authentication. Even tiny
differences in stitching, labels, or packaging can get your item flagged. Almost all
replicas fail here.
• GOAT: Similar to StockX, but also allows pre-owned items. However, GOAT is just as
strict when it comes to verification. They scan both condition and authenticity, so
you need to be extremely careful.
• Alias: A resale platform tied closely with GOAT. It specializes in sneakers and
hypewear. Some sellers report occasional success with lower-tier items, but it’s not
consistent. Most high-end replicas won’t last long
• KLEKT: A European-based alternative to StockX. It follows the same model with full
authentication and tight rules. Like the others, it’s not replica-friendly and should be
avoided unless you have access to top-tier, near-identical items.

Overview
There’s no perfect marketplace that works for everything or everyone. Each
platform has its strengths and weaknesses depending on your location, what
you’re selling, and how much risk you’re willing to take. Your goal should be to use
the ones that match your setup, minimize risk, and give you the best balance of
visibility and control.
Stick to platforms with strong buyer traffic but fewer authentication layers. eBay,
Vinted, Depop, and local apps are the safest starting points. Use Vinted and
Depop for low-risk fashion, and reserve eBay for items that won’t trigger their
Authenticity Guarantee. Your local marketplace—like Subito, Willhaben, or
Kleinanzeigen—can be a goldmine if you handle it properly and rotate your listings
or accounts.
Avoid the temptation to use closed marketplaces like StockX or GOAT unless
you’re selling real items. They are tightly regulated, and their systems are designed
to detect and remove anything suspicious. Even if you succeed once, it's not
worth the risk long-term.
Presentation is everything. Age your accounts, start with clean listings, and slowly
build trust through reviews and consistent behavior. Don’t flood a brand-new
profile with 10 listings overnight. Keep it lowkey, post gradually, and always
respond to buyers quickly and professionally.

Photos and descriptions matter more than most sellers realize. Take clean, well-lit
images and write like you’re running a real store. Be prepared to back up your
listings with receipts or proof if needed. The more professional you seem, the less
likely you are to get flagged—and the more confidence buyers will have.
This guide is part of The Program and will continue to evolve with changes in the
marketplace space. Platforms update their policies all the time. Stick to what
works, follow updates in the Discord, and adjust your strategy as needed. Selling
is a long game. With the right structure, steady habits, and good listings, results
will follow.
